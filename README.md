## 📌 Overview

**Cliberduche Corporation Portal** is a full-stack web application built for a construction company. It serves two audiences:

1. **Public Website** — A dynamic, CMS-driven site showcasing the company's services, projects, team, and contact information.
2. **Internal System Portal** — A role-based admin panel for managing content, procurement, inventory, users, and system operations.

The entire application is built with a **React** SPA frontend consuming a **Laravel 12** REST API backend, following modern full-stack development practices.

## 👥 Team

This project was developed as a team deliverable during our OJT (On-the-Job Training) internship. While this was a group effort, I served as the primary developer — responsible for the full-stack architecture, backend API, authentication, RBAC, testing, and the majority of frontend system modules. Contributions from team members are reflected in the git history.
